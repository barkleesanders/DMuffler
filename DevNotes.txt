To use this version:

1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install numpy sounddevice librosa pyautogui pynput
```

2. Save your audio file (WAV or MP3) in the same directory as the script and update the `audio_file` variable with your filename.

3. Run the script and use the following controls:
- Space bar: Play/Pause
- W key: Hold as gas pedal (gradually increases pitch)
- Up/Down arrows: Manual pitch adjustment
- R: Reset playback
- ESC: Exit the program

This version features:
- Smooth "gas pedal" behavior using the W key
- Gradual pitch increase while W is held
- Automatic return to normal pitch when W is released
- Additional manual controls with arrow keys
- Clean exit with ESC key
- Status messages in the console
- Real-time pitch shifting

The main differences from the previous version are:
1. Uses PyAutoGUI for continuous key state checking (gas pedal)
2. Uses pynput for discrete key press events
3. Adds a more realistic gas pedal behavior with gradual changes
4. Includes status messages for better feedback
5. Adds a clean exit option

Note that PyAutoGUI's key detection might behave differently on different operating systems. If you experience any issues, you might need to adjust the key checking delay or use alternative methods for your specific OS.
